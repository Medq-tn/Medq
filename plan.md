# App Restructuring Plan: Under Construction Mode

## Current State Analysis### Phase 5: Page Cleanup & Removal ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Remove or disable user-facing pages (dashboard, exercices, session, profile, settings, pinned)
- [x] Ensure all user functionality is accessible through admin panel
- [x] Create protection strategy (redirect non-admins to under-construction)
- [x] Generate cleanup documentation and reports

### Phase 6: Testing & Final Validation ⏳ READY
- [ ] Test under-construction page for all non-admin users
- [ ] Test admin access to all admin panel features
- [ ] Verify role-based routing works correctly
- [ ] Test admin user management features
- [ ] Validate user impersonation security
- [ ] Test admin analytics and reporting
- [ ] Performance testing of admin interface
- [ ] Final security audit
### User Flow & Authentication
- **Regular Users & Maintainers**: Currently access dashboard, exercices, sessions, profile, settings, pinned
- **Admin Users**: Have access to all user sections + admin panel
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based routing

### Current Pages Structure
```
src/app/
├── dashboard/          # User dashboard with stats/performance
├── exercices/          # Medical questions/specialties 
├── session/            # Exam sessions view
├── profile/            # User profile management
├── settings/           # User settings
├── pinned/             # Pinned content
├── maintainer/         # Maintainer-specific tools
├── admin/              # Admin panel (full management)
└── auth/               # Authentication pages
```

### Current Roles
- **student**: Regular user access
- **maintainer**: Limited admin access (sessions, reports)
- **admin**: Full system access

## Target State Requirements

### New User Flow
1. **Admin Users** → Direct access to admin panel only
2. **Regular Users + Maintainers** → Redirect to "Under Construction" page
3. **Admin Panel Enhancement** → Move user sections into admin for viewing

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Under Construction Infrastructure
- [ ] Create `/src/app/under-construction/page.tsx`
- [ ] Design user-friendly under construction page
- [ ] Add maintenance messaging and timeline

### Phase 2: Authentication Flow Modification
- [ ] Update `AuthContext.tsx` login redirect logic
- [ ] Modify `ProtectedRoute.tsx` to handle new routing
- [ ] Update middleware for role-based redirects

### Phase 3: Route Protection & Redirection
- [ ] Add redirect logic for non-admin users to under-construction
- [ ] Preserve admin-only access to current admin panel
- [ ] Update sidebar navigation for different user types

### Phase 4: Admin Panel Enhancement ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Step 4.1**: Create admin user dashboard viewing component
  - [x] Create `/src/app/admin/users/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - [x] Create API route `/src/app/api/admin/users/[userId]/dashboard/route.ts`
  - [x] Display user's dashboard statistics and performance
- [x] **Step 4.2**: Create admin user exercises/sessions viewer
  - [x] Create `/src/app/admin/users/exercises/[userId]/page.tsx`
  - [x] Create API route to fetch user's exercise progress
  - [x] Show user's specialty progress and question attempts
- [x] **Step 4.3**: Create admin user profile management
  - [x] Create `/src/app/admin/users/profile/[userId]/page.tsx`
  - [x] Allow admin to view and edit user profiles
  - [x] Show user's personal information and preferences
- [x] **Step 4.4**: Create admin user analytics view
  - [x] Create `/src/app/admin/users/analytics/page.tsx`
  - [x] Show aggregated user statistics
  - [x] Display user engagement and performance metrics
- [x] **Step 4.5**: Update admin navigation
  - [x] Add user management section to admin sidebar
  - [x] Create breadcrumb navigation for user views
  - [x] Add quick access buttons to user actions
- [x] **Step 4.6**: Implement user impersonation/viewing
  - [x] Add "View as User" functionality via `/admin/users/impersonate/[userId]`
  - [x] Create secure impersonation with 2-hour time limit
  - [x] Allow admin to see exactly what user sees

### Phase 5: Page Cleanup & Removal ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] Remove or disable user-facing pages (dashboard, exercices, session, profile, settings, pinned)
- [ ] Keep pages in codebase but make them admin-accessible only
- [ ] Update navigation and routing accordingly

### Phase 6: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test admin login → admin panel access
- [ ] Test regular user login → under construction redirect
- [ ] Test maintainer login → under construction redirect  
- [ ] Verify admin can view user sections within admin panel

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Under Construction Page
**File**: `/src/app/under-construction/page.tsx`
- Attractive design with medical theme
- Maintenance message
- Expected completion timeline
- Contact information for urgent matters

### Step 2: Authentication Logic Update
**Files to modify**:
- `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Update login redirect logic
- `/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Add under-construction redirect
- `/src/middleware.ts` - Add role-based routing

### Step 4: Admin Panel Enhancement
**New admin sections**:
- `/src/app/admin/users/dashboard/[userId]/page.tsx` - View specific user's dashboard
- `/src/app/admin/users/exercises/[userId]/page.tsx` - View user's exercise progress
- `/src/app/admin/users/profile/[userId]/page.tsx` - Manage user profiles
- `/src/app/admin/users/analytics/page.tsx` - User analytics overview
- `/src/app/admin/users/impersonate/[userId]/page.tsx` - User impersonation view

### Step 4: Sidebar Navigation Updates
**File**: `/src/components/layout/AppSidebar.tsx`
- Remove user navigation items for non-admin
- Add admin user management navigation
- Show different sidebar based on role

### Step 5: Route Modifications
**Current user routes → New state**:
- `/dashboard` → Redirect to `/under-construction` (non-admin)
- `/exercices` → Redirect to `/under-construction` (non-admin)  
- `/session` → Redirect to `/under-construction` (non-admin)
- `/profile` → Redirect to `/under-construction` (non-admin)
- `/settings` → Redirect to `/under-construction` (non-admin)
- `/pinned` → Redirect to `/under-construction` (non-admin)
- `/admin/*` → Continue to work (admin only)

### Step 6: Database & API Considerations
- Keep all existing APIs functional
- Admin will access user data through existing APIs
- No database schema changes required
- Maintain all existing functionality within admin context

## Benefits of This Approach

### For Development
- **Clean Separation**: Clear distinction between maintenance mode and admin access
- **Preserved Functionality**: All existing features available to admin for testing/management
- **Easy Rollback**: Can quickly restore user access when ready

### For Users
- **Clear Communication**: Users understand the app is under maintenance
- **Admin Access**: Administrators can continue managing and testing
- **Professional Presentation**: Polished under-construction experience

### For Business
- **Continuous Admin Work**: Development and administration can continue
- **User Expectation Management**: Clear timeline and communication
- **Quality Assurance**: Admin can test all functionality before re-opening

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1-2**: 2-3 hours (Under construction page + auth modifications)
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 hours (Route protection)  
- **Phase 4**: 4-5 hours (Admin panel enhancement)
- **Phase 5**: 1-2 hours (Page cleanup)
- **Phase 6**: 1-2 hours (Testing)

**Total Estimated Time**: 9-14 hours

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
1. **Admin locked out**: Ensure admin role check is robust
2. **API breakage**: Maintain all existing API endpoints
3. **User confusion**: Clear messaging on under-construction page

### Safeguards
1. **Multiple admin accounts**: Ensure fallback admin access
2. **Feature flags**: Ability to quickly toggle functionality
3. **Rollback plan**: Quick restoration of user access if needed

## Next Steps
1. **Approval**: Review and approve this plan
2. **Implementation**: Execute phases in order
3. **Testing**: Thorough testing after each phase
4. **Deployment**: Staged rollout with admin verification
